# Day 1
- First stab at this so I decided to get input from folks that I know that had created successful conferences.
  - I understand it might not be common to have friends that have started conferences.
    - That's why I'm doing this.

## Input from those humans
### Kristi
- It takes a village...
- It's going to use a lot of peoples off-time or down-time too.
- It's a lot of herding cats.
- A number of speakers might cancel last minute.
  - Lots of prep goes into back-up presenters.
- It takes time to get a solid flow going.
- People like extracirriculars.
- Talk to "Chuck." (I still don't know who Chuck is.)
- Is it interactive? (Yes, it will be.)
- Things and people need to be corralled, enclosed, defined, *themed*.
- Can it be 24 hrs of streaming so it's daytime for everyone around the world at one point in the conf?
- There's always someone that doesn't know something that you do know.
- Potential theme: Things you want to learn but are afraid to ask.
- What does it really take to succeed at anything?
- What's the tech setup?
- Sponsorships are difficult to get.
  - You want to give ROI and some kind of theme matching without being too sales-y.
- Why should people watch?

### Melinda
- It's a labor of love, more than anything.
- People love the unconference time.
- Talk to Barry Roberts - he knows a lot.
- Chuck Berry?
- Live chat sounds amazing for this.
- Lock down the content and the theme.
- Special swag for those that attend live, maybe?

# Day 2
- Read a couple of articles on starting conferences.
  - I googled [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=starting+a+tech+conference).
  - Clickbait-y names, but the content isn't terrible: 
    - [Make A 6-Figure Conference](http://anthonyfrasier.com/2016/02/make-a-six-figure-confnerece/)
    - [How We Made Over 100k Doing Tech Events](https://okdork.com/how-we-made-over-100k-doing-tech-events/)
- Come up with a name...
  - I wanted it to be engineering-themed and I love retro shit from my childhood.
    - ConstructiConf = Constructicons (they flippin formed DEVASTATOR) + Conference
  - Searched on [confs.tech](https://confs.tech/) to see if there was any mention of that name.
    - Nothing! Good.
  - Searched twitter for the name as well (@ConstructiConf).
    - Nothing here either. NOICE!
- Heard about [get.tech]() on the [Syntax FM]() podcast - purchased [ConstructiConf.tech](http://ConstructiConf.tech)
- Registered the [@ConstructiConf](https://twitter.com/constructiconf) handle on twitter.
- Forwarded the tech domain to the twitter profile for now.
