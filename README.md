# Logs
This is the repo for all of our log data. I'm trying to log everything in this process to give an idea of what goes into this whole process.

## Daily Logs
This is for logging what I do on a daily basis. It will be in MDX format so it's human-readable (markdown) but also page-able if you spin up the MDX-Deck server and want to page through it.
